# Java-BasicCalculator

This is a basic operations calculator made with Java. 'MathOperations.java' contains the math operations that 'CalculatorApp.java' calls to return the result of the user's calculation based on two input values and a valid operator (+, -, *, /).

If the user inputs an invalid operator, the program returns a custom error. Similarly, the program handles division by zero and returns a custom error message in such cases.
